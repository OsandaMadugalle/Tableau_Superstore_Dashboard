# 📊 Tableau Dashboard Project

## 🔹 Project Overview
This project is part of my **learning roadmap** in Data Analytics.  
The goal is to build an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that visualizes key insights from a real-world dataset.  

The dashboard demonstrates:
- Data connection and preparation  
- Interactive charts and filters  
- Storytelling with visualizations
