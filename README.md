# 📊 Tableau Dashboard Project

## 🔹 Project Overview
This project is part of my **learning roadmap** in Data Analytics.  
The goal is to build an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that visualizes key insights from a real-world dataset.  

The dashboard demonstrates:
- Data connection and preparation  
- Interactive charts and filters  
- Storytelling with visualizations

## 🔹 Data Preparation
-  Data cleaning for the datasets was performed in MS Excel, and I learned using this video tutorial: [Data Cleaning in Excel](https://youtu.be/H0tRB7M4VI8?si=5B0FWTFSWMNNdu0n).
- [Before cleaning](Data%20Clean%20-%20MS%20EXCEL/A%20-%20Before%20Clean.xlsx)
- [After cleaning](Data%20Clean%20-%20MS%20EXCEL/A%20-%20After%20Clean.xlsx)
